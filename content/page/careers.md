## Paid Positions

The Early Childhood Project is recruiting for two positions this Autumn, as we have funding in place to employ an [Outreach Equalities Playworker](/dl/ecp-outreach_playworker_2017-job_app.zip) and a [Toy Library Worker](/dl/ecp-toylib_worker_2017-job_app.zip). These posts are currently part of our work commissioned by the children’s centres for [Brighton and Hove City Council](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/children-and-education/childrens-services/childrens-centres). 

Both posts are for 12 hours a week, are term time only, and are on fixed contracts from 5 September 2017 to 31 March 2018.

## Volunteering

We have worked co-operatively with volunteers for many years and have roles available working alongside us in most of our areas of work. Based within a [Brighton & Hove children’s centre](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/children-and-education/childrens-services/tarner-childrens-centre) means that currently all our volunteers have the advantage of going through the city’s volunteering programme with the extra support and training that comes with it.

All our volunteers are supervised, supported and given in house training around play, equalities, anti-bias practice, office administration… whatever the volunteer’s interest and current skills are we will work with them and help them develop additional skills and new interests, try new experiences, gain confidence and perhaps move on to further training or employment. 

All volunteers are subject to an enhanced [Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service) check at the appropriate level.

Please [contact us](/contact/) for more information or for an informal chat to go through our current volunteering opportunities.
