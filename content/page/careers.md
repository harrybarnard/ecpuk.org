## Volunteering

We have worked co-operatively with volunteers for many years and have roles available working alongside us in most of our areas of work. Based within a [Brighton & Hove children’s centre](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/children-and-education/childrens-services/tarner-childrens-centre) means that currently all our volunteers have the advantage of going through the city’s volunteering programme with the extra support and training that comes with it.

All our volunteers are supervised, supported and given in house training around play, equalities, anti-bias practice, office administration… whatever the volunteer’s interest and current skills are we will work with them and help them develop additional skills and new interests, try new experiences, gain confidence and perhaps move on to further training or employment. 

All volunteers are subject to an enhanced [Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service) check at the appropriate level.

Please [contact us](/contact/) for more information or for an informal chat to go through our current volunteering opportunities.
