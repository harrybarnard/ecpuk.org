We are a unique and innovative educational charity set up in 1988. We are based in Brighton and Hove in the United 
Kingdom and support individuals on the journey around equalities and inclusion. We help develop knowledge and skills 
that enable us to challenge and combat prejudice, discrimination and injustice in the lives of young children.
