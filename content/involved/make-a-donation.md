## Donating Money

<a href="https://localgiving.org/ecpuk" class="btn btn-lg btn-danger">Donate Money Online Now <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i></a>

We can accept cash or cheques in person at any of our sessions. If you would like to send us a cheque please make it 
payable to "Early Childhood Project" and post it to us at [Tarner Children's Centre](/contact/). 
                        
## Donating Resources

### What We Would Like

* Baby, toddler and children's books and toys.
* "How to" books about parenting, weaning etc. for parents and carers.
* "How to" books for early years workers and childcare practitioners.
* Doll's clothes.
* Mother tongue or dual language books for children.

### What We Don't Need

* Big toys like climbing frames, giant doll's houses or bikes.
* Adult or children's dressing up clothes.
* Baby clothes and equipment.

In the event that we receive any items we don't need we pass them on to 
[Brighton Unemployed Centre Families Project](http://bucfp.org/).

Toys and books we can't use or have too many of already are given to families leaving 
[RISE Women's Refuge](http://www.riseuk.org.uk/).

## Donating Your Time

We are always interested in welcoming [volunteers](/work-with-us/) to work alongside us.
