There are many ways to get involved with the Early Childhood Project:

* Use the [Toy Library](https://toylibrarybrightonandhove.org); come, play and borrow!
* Join our community on Facebook; make comments and suggestions, tag us in your photos.
* Attend our play events throughout the year and Annual General Meeting each October.
* [Volunteer with us](/work-with-us/): In the Toy Library, at our outreach sessions, in the children's centre groups, 
  fundraising, covering books, researching play ideas and topics.
* Donate books and toys to the toy library; If we don't need them, we pass them on to families leaving the 
  [RISE Women's Refuge](http://www.riseuk.org.uk/).
* Keep in touch; we still hear from families who have re-located to other continents.
* Teach us a new song.
* Show us how you will be celebrating your next festival.
* Tell us what matters to you and your children; [in person, by phone, email](/contact/) or 
  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/toylibrarybrightonandhove/).
