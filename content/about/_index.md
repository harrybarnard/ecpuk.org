We believe that all children have the right to develop in a positive environment free from prejudice and discrimination. 
We are a registered charity and work positively to combat bias of every kind in co-operation with others across 
Brighton and Hove. We provide information, resources and support to all those people involved in young childrenâ€™s care, 
play and education.
