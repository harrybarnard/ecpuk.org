We offer a number of services to the community that supports and reinforces our other work. These include:

*   Preparing for an [OFSTED](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted) inspection and dealing with the aftermath.
*   Consulting for [Equality Impact Assessments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_impact_assessment).
*   How to be equalities minded and inclusive when dealing with pre-school age children and their parents and carers.
*   Advice on dealing with (potentially awful) unexpected events, for example: bereavement, deportation, terminal 
    illness and family issues like divorce in a pre-school environment.
*   Advice relating to human resources for example hiring and firing and supporting workers in a pre-school setting.
*   Recruiting, supporting and retaining volunteers.
*   Procuring and maintaining toys and other resources, especially to reinforce anti-bias play in a pre-school 
    environment.
*   Advice on setting up and supporting new or ailing community groups and charities.
