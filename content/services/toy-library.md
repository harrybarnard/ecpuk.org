This has been the core service of the Early Childhood Project since 1988. We have offered a wide selection of carefully 
chosen resources that reflect family life and diversity and uphold an anti-bias approach to play, care and education.

We also support families with advice, information and signposting to other appropriate services.

We encourage positive parenting through our own good practice, excellent books and thoughtfully sourced leaflets that 
aim to help parents, carers and those working with and supporting families and children.

We help parents and carers choose age and stage appropriate books and toys and help them to develop their children's 
play. We have books, toys, games, dolls and puppets and resources for children from babies up to eight year olds.

When we open the Toy Library door and welcome children and their adults in with, "Are you here to play? Come and see!", 
the door opens beyond borrowing books and toys. They have access to a warm and friendly welcome, a safe and fun space in
which to sit and play, make friends, chat, laugh, cry, sing, swap stories and to feel a valued part of our ever-changing 
community.

We provide a dedicated website for users of the Toy Library service at [toylibrarybrightonandhove.org](https://toylibrarybrightonandhove.org).

## Membership

Our membership is mainly families and childminders, students studying for early years qualifications and early years 
settings and workers.

To borrow from the Toy Library a small annual membership fee is charged.

A selection of Toy Library resources may be borrowed at any one time and kept for up to two months. We don't nag or 
fine for late returns!
