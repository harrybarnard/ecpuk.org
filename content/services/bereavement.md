We offer sensitive support with age appropriate resources for families experiencing grief and loss. We also offer 
support and information for those working with them.

We have looked at all the issues around bereavement and put together lots of information and how to support children 
through this challenging process.

We are also able to offer training to early years workers and settings, schools, childminders or anyone with an interest 
in supporting children through bereavement.
