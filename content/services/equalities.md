ECP is commissioned to run training courses for adults working with and caring for children around varied equalities and diversity issues.

## Family Support

We support families with advice, information and signposting to other appropriate services and encourage positive parenting through our excellent positive parenting books and carefully sourced leaflets that aim to help parents and carers navigate many tricky areas like potty training, tantrums, sibling rivalry and play and child development.

We provide sessions and workshops to parents around play ideas and are very good at coming up with no-cost play resources!

Our unique overview of family life across the city has enabled ECP to hold a strategic role in planning around local services for children for many years.

## Equalities Support Sessions For Under 5s Services

Tailor made visits for pre-schools and crèches supporting anti-bias and inclusion work, making sure that all children are represented through the resources workers use through our toy library service.
