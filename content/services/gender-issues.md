The Jill & Jack group discuss and challenge assumptions around gender and children and provide a thought-provoking platform to deconstruct stereotypes.

Recurring topics since the group was set up in 1990 have included:

* Barbies and Action Man
* Girls and pink
* Guns and superhero play
* Media and advertising in children's lives
* Roles of men and women in family life
* Do girls and boys learn and play differently?

Our collection of articles, leaflets and cuttings around gender issues and children is the largest in the [Toy Library](/toy-library/) archive. We shall publish some as the topics come to the forefront again.
