We work with young children, their families and those who work with them, encouraging, supporting and developing anti-bias
play, care and education. Our work centres on our toy library and we run equalities play sessions, anti-bias training,
bereavement support to families, and have for many years held a community activist role, representing those children
whose voices are rarely heard in the city.
