We offer sensitive support with age appropriate resources for families experiencing grief and loss. We also offer support and information for those working with them.

We have looked at all the issues around bereavement and put together lots of information and how to support children through this challenging process.

We are also able to offer training to early years workers and settings, schools, childminders or anyone with an interest in supporting children through bereavement.
